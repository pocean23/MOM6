Spatial Discretization
=========

The model equations are the layer-integrated vector-invariant form of the
hydrostatic primitive equations (either Boussinesq or non-Boussinesq).

We present the equations starting from the hydrostatic Boussinesq equation in
height coordinates and progress through vector-invariant and
general-coordinate equations to the final equations used in the A.L.E.
algorithm.
